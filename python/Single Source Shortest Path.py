# üìò Problem: Single Source Shortest Path (Dijkstra Template)
# Given a directed graph with non-negative edge weights, compute the shortest distances
# from a starting node to all other nodes.
#
# Parameters:
# - n: Total number of nodes in the graph, labeled from 0 to n-1.
# - edges: A list of tuples (u, v, w) where u -> v is a directed edge with weight w.
# - start: The starting node to compute shortest paths from.
#
# Returns:
# - A list `dist` of size n, where dist[i] is the shortest distance from `start` to node i.
#   If a node is unreachable, its distance should be -1.
