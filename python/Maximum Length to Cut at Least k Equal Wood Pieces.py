# You are given an array wood where wood[i] represents the length of the i-th wooden stick.
# Your task is to cut these sticks into pieces of equal length, such that you can make at least k pieces in total.
# Find the maximum possible length of each piece that allows you to make at least k pieces.
from itertools import count


# Input: wood = [9, 7, 5], k = 5
# Output: 5
#
# Explanation:
# If you cut each stick into length 5:
# - 9 â†’ one piece of 5
# - 7 â†’ one piece of 5
# - 5 â†’ one piece of 5
#
# You get 3 pieces â€” not enough.
#
# Try length 3:
# - 9 â†’ 3 pieces
# - 7 â†’ 2 pieces
# - 5 â†’ 1 piece
#
# Total: 6 pieces â†’ âœ… OK
#
# Now binary search for the maximum length that gives at least 5 pieces.
# The answer is 5.

    Given an array `wood` where wood[i] represents the length of the i-th wooden stick,
    cut the sticks into pieces of equal length to obtain at least `k` pieces.

    Return the maximum possible length of each piece that allows at least k pieces in total.

    Input: wood = [9, 7, 5], k = 5
